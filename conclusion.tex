\section{Conclusion}

The LSST Data Management Team consists of more than one hundred people spread across multiple locations.
In this paper we have described our current developer processes and explained how they have evolved over time and how we foresee them evolving in the future.
The LSST Data Management software development has been ongoing for at least 14 years and we hope that our processes will continue to evolve, based on experience and new technologies, as we transition from construction to operations through to the end of the survey in 2032.
