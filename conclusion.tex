\section{Conclusion}

The LSST Data Management Team consists of more than ninety people spread across multiple locations.
In this paper we have described our current developer processes and explained both how they have evolved over time and how we foresee them evolving in the future.
The LSST Data Management software development has been ongoing for at least 14 years, and we expect that our processes will continue to evolve, based on experience and new technologies, as we transition from construction to operations through to the end of the survey in 2032.
