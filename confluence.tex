\subsection{Confluence}
We use confluence  as a compliment to Jira e.g. for meeting minutes and for initial drafts of some technical notes.
The ability to embed Jira tickets into pages and for pages to have embedded Jira queries, along with the simple tasks system, makes Confluence an excellent choice for storing meeting minutes.
We do assign tasks during meetings and track open tasks, but we have a policy to migrate tasks to Jira tickets if it looks like a task is going to involve significant work.
It can then be scheduled as part of the normal planning process.
We have found that another place where Confluence is useful is for collaborating on hack sessions.
A simple table on a page showing the status of related Jira tickets and associated people can help to avoid duplicate work.
Finally, Confluence can be used for collating information for a transient purpose, with the understanding that if the information is to be persisted it should be migrated to a Tech Note.
